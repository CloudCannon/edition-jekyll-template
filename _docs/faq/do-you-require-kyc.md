title: Do BTM require verification or KYC?
order: 5
---

[BitcoinVN](https://bitcoinvn.io/en), as the operator of the BTMs, does not require any verification or KYC on transactions 
executed via a BTM. 

A mobile number is required for the operation of the BTM. It allows customers to
1. pre-sell cryptocurrencies online to reduce the wait time at the BTM and to
2. privately view links with the latest status of the transaction.

Although we recommend using your personal mobile phone, the BTM would also work with an anonymous phone number like 
the ones offered by [ReceiveSMS](https://receive-smss.com).
