Step 9 - The transaction is completed!
=============
+ Once you reach this screen, your Bitcoin will be sent ASAP. Occasionally, due to slow Bitcoin blockchain, it can take up to 30 minutes for you to see Bitcoin in your wallet
+ You can click the link sent via SMS to track the progress. Otherwise you can track the progress of your transaction by visiting [https://bitaccessbtm.com/account/signin](https://bitaccessbtm.com/account/signin) and signing in with the same mobile number as was used to make the transaction
