To buy crypto, we recommend using a personal wallet (e.g. by downloading Trust Wallet app), but you can also use a 
paper wallet or an exchange wallet. If BTM does not recognise the wallet, then please make sure you use a legacy 
(or non segwit) Bitcoin wallet, such as Trust Wallet app or BTC.COM app).

To sell crypto, we recommend using a personal wallet (e.g. by downloading Trust Wallet app). Exchange wallets can 
cause delays and cancelled transactions.
