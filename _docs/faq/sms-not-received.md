title: I can't receive the verification SMS?
order: 11
---

Some Vietnamese network operators, primarily Mobifone, occasionally block BTM SMS. If you are unable to receive the verification SMS within a couple of minutes, you have a number of alternatives:

1. Use another non-Mobifone SIM card. This can be a Vietnamese number or an overseas number
2. Use a virtual SMS number, for example on https://receive-smss.com/
3. Contact the number shown on the BTM. We will use our company's SIM card in order to provide the verification code to you
