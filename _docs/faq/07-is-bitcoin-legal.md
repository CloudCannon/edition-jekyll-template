title: Is buying and selling Bitcoin legal in Vietnam?
order: 7

Purchasing/trading Bitcoin and other similar virtual currencies remains **not** illegal. Only using them as means of 
payment in Vietnam violates the law.

[BitcoinVN](https://bitcoinvn.io/en) has successfully operated since 2013. BitcoinVN is in 
[constant communication with the government](https://news.bitcoinvn.io/doi-thoai-ve-khung-phap-ly-lien-quan-ung-dung-cong-nghe-blockchain/?lang=vi). 
We are willing to help regulate the Bitcoin and BTM markets as they are currently not regulated in Vietnam.
