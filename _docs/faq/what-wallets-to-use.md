title: BTM does not recognise my Bitcoin wallet?
order: 8
---

BTMs currently support only the "segwit compatible" Bitcoin wallet format. If BTM does not recognise your wallet, then please either change the wallet address type, or import the wallet into Mycelium or BTC.com wallets.

As a reminder, we always recommend using a personal wallet (e.g. Mycelium or BTC.com). Other wallets can be used to buy cryptocurrency, but using exchange wallets to sell can cause delays or cancelled transactions.
