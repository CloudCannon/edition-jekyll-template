Please ensure that
  * The wallet is in format of a QR code. If you use a service to convert a text address into a QR code (such as [this one](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/solutions/bitcoin-qr-code/)), you can check that the QR code address is correct by converting it back to text using your mobile wallet, or a QR code reader on your phone, or [this tool](https://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx) or [this one](https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/scan)
  * The brightness on your phone screen is set to maximum
  * The address is in "SegWit Compatible (P2SH)" format. These addresses start with a 3. If your app doesn't support this format, you can use another wallet, such as Electrum, as shown below.

As a reminder, we always recommend using a personal wallet (e.g. Mycelium or BTC.com). Other wallets can be used to buy cryptocurrency, but using exchange wallets to sell can cause delays or cancelled transactions.
