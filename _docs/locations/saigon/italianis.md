Led by the [young Vietnamese entrepreneurs Kevin and Ariel](https://news.bitcoinvn.io/interview-with-ariel-nguyen-of-italianis) Italianiâ€™s has been a meeting point for the local Bitcoin community since 2016. As such, their original location also wrote a little Vietnamese Bitcoin history, hosting the very first Bitcoin ATM in Vietnam back in 2016.

Their venue in Han Thuyen is located romantically right next to 30/04 park between the Independence palace and Notre Dame church.
