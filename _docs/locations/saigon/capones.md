If you got cravings for a typical Chicago-area Deep Dish Pizza - Capone’s got you covered. The Pizza pies are huge - and if that is still not enough for you, Capone’s got the “Double Decker” version on the menu to really fill you up!

One of the highlights of the location is the stunning riverside view with a look right onto South-East Asia’s tallest building, the Landmark 81 at Vinhomes Central Park.
