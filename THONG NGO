~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~

### Documentation pages

* Documentation pages are organised in the navigation by category, with URLs based on the path inside the `_docs` folder.

### Change log

* Add, update or remove change log entries from your posts.
* Tag entries as minor or major in the front matter.

### Search

* Add `excluded_in_search: true` to any documentation page's front matter to exclude that page in the search results.

## The Goal
The goal is to build a website ([https://acceptBitcoin.cash]
(https://acceptBitcoin.Cash)) with a comprehensive list of sites that accept or
support Bitcoin Cash, as well as Bitcoin (Legacy).
Our hope is to connect consumers and merchants, while spreading awareness and
promoting global adoption of [Bitcoin Cash](https://www.bitcoincash.org).
The site maintainers do not endorse nor confirm the legitimacy of any of the
listings linked to on this site. This is an open source project which accepts
submissions from the general community. While we try our best to verify the
information submitted, it's possible that we may miss something.
## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to the list, please read the entire guidelines here
in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
## Running Locally
acceptBitcoin.cash is built upon [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), using the
[github-pages](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) gem.
In order to run the site locally, it is necessary to install bundler, install all
dependencies, and then use Jekyll to serve
the site. If the `gem` command is not available to you, it is necessary to
install Ruby with RubyGems.
Once Ruby and RubyGems are installed and available from the command line,
acceptBitcoin.cash can be setup using the following commands.
```
gem install bundler
cd ~/acceptbitcoincash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
The acceptBitcoin.cash website should then be accessible from

`https://bitcoincash.org`.
## Docker
acceptBitcoin.cash also includes a Docker image for easy deployment. You can
build and run the Docker image using the following commands.
```
cd ~/acceptbitcoincash
gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll build
docker build -t acceptbitcoincash .
docker run -p4000:80 acceptbitcoincash
```
If you are doing development, and want to launch a jekyll server which can track
your changes. Then you can use the following commands.
```
cd ~/acceptbitcoincash
docker run --rm --label=jekyll --volume=$(pwd):/srv/jekyll:z \
-it -p 127.0.0.1:4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll:latest jekyll s
```
The acceptBitcoin.cash website should then be accessible from
`https://bitcoincash.org`.
